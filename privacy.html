            I don't have a typical corporate privacy policy. For two reasons: 1) Lawyers are expensive. 2) Most privacy policies just ensure that the company gets to do whatever they want with your data.

            I hate that.
            
            So here's my Privacy Promise instead... I will never sell your data, I will only sell you services. If you choose to input your contact information in any context or form I take that as a great privelege and responsibility and I will only communicate with you when I believe it would be what you want me to do. And you can withdraw your communication or your data consent whenever you wish to drop my services. :) All the best friend, I'm on team YOU ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
